PSG is a lightweight MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed for Node.js and Express, offering a structured approach to building scalable applications while effectively separating application logic. Its key features include adhering to the MVC architecture, intuitive routing through Express, support for various database systems, the use of templating engines like EJS for dynamic views, and the ability to employ Express middleware for common tasks such as authentication and error handling.
